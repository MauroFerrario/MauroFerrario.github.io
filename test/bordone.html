<p>Different possible scenarios:
a)      Quantum walk of a single particle subject to an electric field oscillating in time and the appearence of topologically protected states at the edge of the simulation domain. Comparison with the Haldane model of anisotropic and complex hopping.
b)      Quantum walk of a particle in a magnetic field (possibly with spin) and/or in the presence of classical noise.
c)      Two particles quantum walk, with the inclusion of external fields and/or the study of different topologies.</p>

<h2>Abstract<a class="headerlink" href="#id1" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>The purpose of the thesis is to introduce, in the study of quantum walks in the presence of an electric field, a dissipative noise (that is a mechanism exchanging energy with the particle), with the aim of obseving a transition from the Bloch oscillations regime to the one of ohmic transport. The idea is to try to introduce a dissipative noise for qubits in the Haniltonian of the system, for example introducing an external field interacting with the particles.</p>

<p>Quantum bits (or qubits) are the fundamental units of quantum computing. Recently, many methods of encoding flying qubits have been proposed, and one of the most promising is the use of co-propagating edge states of different Landau levels, i.e. ballistic channels which arise in a magnetic field in the IQHE and which are characterized by large coherence lengths. This approach does not suffer from the topological problem of the traditional systems used in the literature, where the use of identical edge channels (of the same Landau level but separated in space) imposes strong limits in the scalability of the logic gates, which is a key requirement for quantum computing. Moreover, recent experimental advancement made single-electron sources available for solid-states devices: a result which opens new fascinating possibilities in the processing of the information encoded in a single carrier at a time.
Our research group recently approached the coherent transport inside edge channels and developed some numerical codes and analytical methods to characterize the transport of localized carriers in solid-state single-particle logic gates (such as Mach-Zehnder interferometers). The goal of this master thesis is the characterization (via numerical simulations) of the interference process inside a Mach-Zehnder logic gate realized through co-propagating edge channels, in which we inject electrons modelled with localized wavefunctions. Many key features – including the spread of the wavefunction, the energy selectivity of the scattering, the differences in the group velocities of the carriers – need to be explored in order to optimize the operating conditions of the device.</p>

<p>Quantum walks are the quantum analogous of the classical random walks and describe the propagation of a quantum particle over a n-dimensional graph.  Because of their quantum nature, which allows for quantum superposition of states and interference, quantum walks show a very different behavior compared to their classical counterparts. This behavior allows one to exploit quantum walks for tasks that cannot be achieved with the limited resources of classical random walks. For this reason, a lot of interest has arisen around quantum walks, especially because of their central role in non-deterministic algorithms, universal quantum computation, and in modeling processes in biological systems. Usually, in the literature, quantum walks are described in terms of the diffusion of particles over a perfect periodic potential, where it is assumed that no defects or disorder in the lattice enter the picture. However, in realistic physical implementation of quantum walks noise is always present, due to fabrication imperfections or by the inevitable interaction with the external environment which induces decoherence.
The aim of the proposed thesis is to study, both for the cases of fermions and bosons, the quantum walks of two interacting particles on a lattice in the presence of dynamical disorder. The relative contributions of the interaction intensity and of the noise parameters on the dynamics effects will be investigated, as well as the transition between the quantum and the classical behavior. The study is performed using analytical (in particular resorting to the density matrix formalism) and numerical approaches.</p>
