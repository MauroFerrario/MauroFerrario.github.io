<h2>Abstract<a class="headerlink" href="#abstract" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>A large sample of final states containing two charmed particles have been selected from LHCb (<a class="reference external" href="http://cern.ch/lhcb">http://cern.ch/lhcb</a>) data collected in 2011 and 2012.
The proposed work consists of a search for B meson decays into final states containing two charmed particles using machine learning techniques (e.g. neural networks).
Some of these decays have already been observed by BaBar and Belle experiments at e+e- colliders, others are likely to be observed for the first time by LHCb.
An introductory level knowledge of elementary particle physics and a working knowledge of programming languages (especially python and/or C++) would be useful.</p>

<p>The NA62 experiment (<a class="reference external" href="http://cern.ch/na62">http://cern.ch/na62</a>) at CERN SPS, aimed to measure the very small (order 10^-10) K+ -&gt; pi+ nu nubar branching fraction, relies on a RICH detector for pion/muon separation, time measurement and level 0 trigger.
Large data samples being collected in 2015 will be used to determine its performances and to optimize the reconstruction algorithms.</p>

<h2>Abstract<a class="headerlink" href="#id3" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>The Xibc state is a predicted baryon containing a b quark, a c quark, and a light quark (u or d).
According to recent theoretical prediction the observation of these states at LHCb is not out of reach, already using the dataset collected in 2011 and 2012.
The proposed work consists of a first part of review of the theoretical and experimental activities related to the baryons containing two heavy states, and in a second part oriented to the development of an analysis challenging the presence of the Xibc meson in the collected data.
The results of this work are of great importance to extrapolate the potential of the LHCb experiment to the larger dataset expected for the coming years.</p>

<h2>Abstract<a class="headerlink" href="#id5" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>The LHC, during its operations, has changed center-of-mass energy of the proton-proton collisions several times.
The measurement of the production cross-section of quarkonia states can be repeated on different data samples in order to determine its dependence on the center-of-mass energy.
Such dependence is relevant for theoretical models used to describe QCD and formulate hypotheses for the production of quarkonia states in heavy ion collisions.
The candidate is invited to get confidence with the most recent measurements of the J/psi production cross-section and to reproduce the measurement on a different data sample or for a different quarkonium state.</p>

<h2>Abstract<a class="headerlink" href="#id7" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>The decay B+ -&gt; D D K is one of the few 3-body decay modes containing two charmed particles in the final state.
It has been studied by Belle and Babar, finding interesting results on the existence of new charmed states, and it is under scrutiny in LHCb to measure the branching ratio of the  D+ D- K final state relative to D0 D0bar K.
Amplitude Analysis formalism is a very powerful technique to describe multi-body decays through the simultaneous fit to the distributions of several angles and invariant masses of combinations of the daughter particles.
The candidate is invited to get confidence with amplitude analyses and to implement the world&#8217;s first full amplitude analysis of this decay mode using the events collected by the LHCb experiment during the first run of the LHC.</p>

<h2>Abstract<a class="headerlink" href="#id8" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>The likelihood function can be defined as the probability that a certain
hypothesis is experimentally verified as a given set of observations or facts.
According to the Neyman-Pearson lemma, the discrimination between two hypoteses
based on the likelihood ratio is the most powerful. Likelihood has also
the nice property that contributions from different, uncorrelated observations
can be combined as a product. The particle identification of the LHCb experiment
combines likelihoods computed in different sub-detectors to distinguish particles
traversing the detector as electrons, muons, pions, kaons, and protons.
The candidate is invited to get involved in the muon group, implement and
calibrate new techniques to define the likelihood of a particle as a muon,
and test the performance of the new algorithm on the data collected in 2015.</p>

<h2>Abstract<a class="headerlink" href="#id10" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Simulating Particle Identification variables is hard, a technique based on
Density Estimation Trees was investigated and found to promising as a tool to
recalibrate the simulated variables during the production jobs. The challenging
aspect of the algorithm is to build a recalibration curve in four dimensions
(three kinematic variables, and the simulated variable). This requires a large
amount of simulated and real data to properly sample the parameter space.
Besides, since the real performance of the algorithm vary with time, it is
important to define different calibrations for different periods of data
acquisition. The candidate is invited to understand the mechanism of the
recalibration and to test the quality of the procedure by comparing the
distribution of particle identification variables in simulated and real
samples for a selection of modes used as normalization in many physics analyses.</p>

<h2>Abstract<a class="headerlink" href="#id12" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Density Estimation Trees are fast algorithms used to learn probability
distributions from large datasets, store them and integrate out conditional pdfs.
The learning algorithm is embarrassingly parallel problem since more than one
branch can be grown at a time. Opportunities for the integrating algorithm
are also interesting. Since these algorithms are conceived to be fast, in contrast
with Kernel Density Estimations which are built to be precise, it is important to
clean their implementation to fully profit of them. The candidate is invited to
understand the learning and integrating algorithms and to explore opportunities
for parallelization with both multi-threading and heterogeneous computing
techniques.</p>
