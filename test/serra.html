<h2>Abstract<a class="headerlink" href="#abstract" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>A protocell is a cell-like structure, similar to but much simpler than present-day biological cells, that is composed by a lipid vesicle that can undergo spontaneous fission. Moreover, it also contains a family of “genetic memory molecules”, capable of self-reproduction, that affects the growth rate of the protocell. This architecture can thus provide the basis for darwinian evolution. Starting from abiotic components it has not yet been possible to build protocells, but mathematical models can provide useful information about what is needed and their behaviours. Our group has developed in recent years an original model that will be used to assess the outcome of different operating conditions. Moreover, since a single duplication event would not be particularly relevant, major emphasis will be placed on the conditions that can assure sustainable growth of a population of protocells.</p>

<h2>Abstract<a class="headerlink" href="#id2" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>The organization of complex systems is often hard to understand, as it does not follow a simple hierarchical scheme. In particular, in important cases the structure of the relationships is not tree-like but it rather resembles a network (“entangled hierarchies”). The first step in deciphering the organization of a totally or partially unknown system is that of grouping together those variables that change in time in a coordinated way; a second step consists in understanding the causal relationships between these groups of variables. Our group has developed methods, based on Shannon entropy, in order to achieve these goals, that have been tested both on perfectly known “toy” models and on real systems. The present work addresses two different but related issues: i) the use of entropy measures that are different from those that have been tested so far (Shannon entropy , mutual information, integration) and ii) the determination of the conditions that allow the application of Transfer Entropy and Information Flow to determine some causal relationships in dynamical systems.</p>

<h2>Abstract<a class="headerlink" href="#id4" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Not all the genes in a cell are simoultaneously active, their expression being affected by the expression of other genes as well as by other variables like e.g. the presence of various chemicals, etc.  Simplified boolean models have been extensively studied, and we have shown that in some cases their outcomes can be compared with actual experimental data. What is even more intriguing is that these comparisons allow us to draw conclusions, based on experimental data and nonlinear dynamical models, concerning the issue of cell criticality. This is indeed a major theoretical concept that has been proposed by several authors: according to its supporters, biological evolution should have driven living organisms in regions (of parameter space) that are located at, or close to, the boundaries between regions of highly ordered behaviours and regions of disordered behaviours. The thesis will follow two synergistic pathways: i) development of the theoretical description (concerning in particular self-interacting avalanches of perturbations) and ii) comparison of the model outcomes with available data concerning biological organisms (i.e. the yeast S. Cerevisiae)</p>
